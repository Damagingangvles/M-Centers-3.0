To begin using M Centers 3.0, you must first open the folder named "M-Centers-3.0-x64". Inside, you'll find all the necessary files to launch the mod and activate its features. Make sure to access the folder before attempting any installation or setup steps.

After pressing “Unlock Minecraft,” you need to choose the correct version for your PC.

- If your computer runs on x64 architecture, click on x64.

- If your computer runs on x32 architecture, click on x32. Since most modern PCs use x64, this is usually the option you should select.

Once the demo is installed, return to M Centers 3.0 and click Start Operation. At this point, the setup will look just like the images you’ve seen, showing that the mod is running correctly.
